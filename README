This is a symfony plugin that aims to provide the same interface for validating forms on the client browser as is available to the server through the sfForm framework and the sfValidators.

It is based on my orginal sfPokeYokePlugin, developed for the 1.0 branch of symfony.

This is a direct port of the symfony-project.org form validation scheme to JavaScript. This will be integrated with the existing PokeYoke validation system to provide seamless client side form validation based on the existing server side validation.
